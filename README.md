RWSlider
==========

An implementation of UISlider, but for desktop Cocoa development.

This class lets you set the background image, alternative image and thumbnail.



Alternatives
=================

  * [prhonoffbutton](https://bitbucket.org/boredzo/prhonoffbutton)
   (RWSlider assumes you're bringing in your own art, instead of building the control in code)

  * [SliderControl, from the Cooliris Toolkit](http://code.google.com/p/cooliris-toolkit). (SliderControl is for UIKit, but RWSlider was based off this control)
